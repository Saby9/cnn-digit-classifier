# Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale, each 28x28 pixels. This project aims to build a CNN model that can accurately classify these digits.

# Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
